# tic-tac-toe1
GA Project 1
Notes
For my game I’ve decided to choose 9 article tags as my grid layout.
Var for player 1 and 2. Use of statement to set Conditions for the amount of turns each player can have in total, on the basis that, another condition being player 1 or 2 hasn’t already got 3 knots or crosses in a row, either diagonally or horizontally;
add at most (hopefully) one or two event listeners for this purpose.
However, I just want the code to work rather than it look perfect at first so I know I may use more than 2.
I will utilise CSS to achieve the basic design of the game without it being too complicated.
Defining the margin, padding, border-radius, width/height of boxes, background-color.
this is my thought process so far
