Notes
For my game I’ve decided to choose 9 article tags as my grid layout.
Update: I ended up switching to div tags as they were more familiar, and I could actually grasp how to make a grid with them. There was a lot of overthinking, until I finally established the grid.
Now I want to set up the conditions for 'X' and 'O' to alternate when a box is clicked
Var for player 1 and 2. 
Use of statement to set Conditions for the amount of turns each player can have in total, on the basis that, another condition being player 1 or 2 hasn’t already got 3 knots or crosses in a row, either diagonally or horizontally;
Add at most (hopefully) one or two event listeners for this purpose.
However, I just want the code to work rather than it look perfect at first so I know I may use more than 2.
I will utilise CSS to achieve the basic design of the game without it being too complicated.
Defining the margin, padding, border-radius, width/height of boxes, background-color.
this is my thought process so far
